What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n","**Ans:** An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.

Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n","**Ans:** if a child class has **`__init__`** method, then it will not inherit the **`__init__`** method of the parent class. in other words the **`__init__`** method of the child class overrides the **`__init__`** method of the parent class. so we have to manually call a parent superclass's **`__init__`** using **`super()`** method"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Person:\n","  def __init__(self,name,age):\n","    self.name=name\n","    self.age=age\n","class Employee(Person):\n","  def __init__(self,name,age,salary,company):\n","    super().__init__(name,age)\n","    self.salary=salary\n","    self.company=company\n","\n","emp_1=Employee('raj',25,25000,'ibm')\n","print(emp_1.__dict__)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CC8cm_94u-wa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690703357696,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Suman Hachappa","userId":"02923451167331183866"}},"outputId":"843903cf-b59b-40fd-feb7-a6b446d8ead2"},"id":"CC8cm_94u-wa","execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'name': 'raj', 'age': 25, 'salary': 25000, 'company': 'ibm'}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f7468111","metadata":{"id":"f7468111"},"source":["#### 4.

How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n","**Ans:** A Variable which is defined inside a function is local to that function. it is accesible from the point at which it is defined until the end of the function, and exists for as long as the function is existing.\n","\n","Similary a variable inside of a class also has a local variable scope.
