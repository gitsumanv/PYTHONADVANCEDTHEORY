Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n","**Ans:** **`__iter__`** and **`__next__`** are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.\n","\n","- **`__iter__`** returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.\n","- **`__next__`** is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value.
